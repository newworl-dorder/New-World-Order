    <meta name="description" content="Pakistan is once again shaken by a horrifying case of so-called “honor killing” after a father brutally murdered his teenage daughter for posting TikTok videos. The 19-year-old girl, known for her joyful and creative content, was reportedly strangled to death in their home in Lahore after her father found out about her social media presence.

        <p>
            Pakistan is once again shaken by a horrifying case of so-called “honor killing” after a father brutally murdered his teenage daughter for posting TikTok videos. The 19-year-old girl, known for her joyful and creative content, was reportedly strangled
            to death in their home in Lahore after her father found out about her social media presence. Eyewitnesses say the man showed no remorse, claiming he was "protecting family dignity." But what dignity exists in killing your own child? Social
            activists and netizens are furious, demanding the strictest punishment and justice for the slain girl. This shocking crime exposes the dark reality of honor-based violence, where daughters are killed simply for expressing themselves. How many
            more innocent lives will be lost before society wakes up? The question remains—will justice be served, or will another killer walk free under the veil of twisted traditions?
